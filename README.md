Early experiments in computer vision took place in the 1950s, using some of the first neural networks to detect the edges of an object and to sort simple objects into categories like circles and squares.

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.

# Image Processsing vs Computer vision
ðŸš€Image processing primarily deals with manipulating or enhancing existing images. It involves techniques to perform operations on images, such as filtering, noise reduction, image compression, and image enhancement. 

The goal of image processing is often to improve the visual appearance of images or to extract some specific information from them. Examples of image processing tasks include resizing, cropping, sharpening, color correction, and feature extraction.

ðŸ’¡ Key techniques used in image processing include:

Filters and Transformations: Applying mathematical operations like convolution to alter images, such as blurring or sharpening.

Image Restoration: Removing noise or artifacts from images to improve quality.

Image Compression: Reducing the size of image data for storage or transmission.

Color Processing: Adjusting color balance, contrast, or brightness of images.

ðŸš€Computer vision, on the other hand, is a broader field that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos. It goes beyond basic image processing tasks to extract meaningful information from visual data. Computer vision aims to replicate human vision capabilities using machines. This involves tasks such as object detection, recognition, tracking, scene reconstruction, and image understanding.

# ðŸ’¡Key techniques used in computer vision include:

Object Detection and Recognition: Identifying objects within images or video streams.

Image Classification: Categorizing images into predefined classes.

Semantic Segmentation: Assigning specific labels to each pixel in an image to identify objects and boundaries.

3D Reconstruction: Creating three-dimensional models or scenes from multiple images or video frames.

### ðŸš€Relationship Between the Two:

Image processing techniques are often foundational to computer vision tasks. Before higher-level analysis or understanding can occur, images may need to undergo preprocessing steps (like noise reduction or normalization) using image processing techniques. Once images are processed, computer vision algorithms can then operate on the resulting data to extract more complex information.
